# Redux `react-chart-editor` example

This example built with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) uses the `DefaultEditor`, with synchronously-loaded data and a [Redux](https://redux.js.org) for state manage, so as to demo the Redux machinery required to.

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm start
```
