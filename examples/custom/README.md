# Custom `react-chart-editor` example

This example built with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) uses a [customized editor](src/CustomEditor.js), with synchronously-loaded data and a top-level component for state, so as to demo the customizability of this component.

The custom editor shows minimal examples of various built-in elements, as well as how to extend elements to create customized behaviour.

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm start
```
